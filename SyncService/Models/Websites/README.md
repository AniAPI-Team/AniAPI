# Adding a new website

In case you want to add your favourite website to AniAPI's core, you can find here some useful infos.

[Be sure to setup your environment correctly](https://github.com/AniAPI-Team/AniAPI/tree/main/GETTING_STARTED.md)

[How to add a website to our scraper engine](https://github.com/AniAPI-Team/AniAPI/blob/main/ScraperEngine)

## IWebsite

Create a class with the following naming convention:

`{WebsiteName}Website`

Let's say for example `GogoanimeWebsite`.

Now, declare it `public` and let it inherits `IWebsite`, like below:

```csharp
public class GogoanimeWebsite : IWebsite {

  public GogoanimeWebsite(Website website) : base(website)
  {
  }

  public override bool AnalyzeMatching(Anime anime, AnimeMatching matching, string sourceTitle)
  {
    // Insert here your custom logic
    // in order to customize anime matchings

    // Be sure to call super method!
    return base.AnalyzeMatching(anime, matching, sourceTitle);
  }

  public override string BuildAPIProxyURL(AppSettings settings, AnimeMatching matching, string url, Dictionary<string, string> values = null)
  {
    // Insert here your custom logic
    // in order to customize the values
    // used while building the proxy url

    // Be sure to call super method!
    return base.BuildAPIProxyURL(settings, matching, url, values);
  }
}
```

### AnalyzeMatching

This is the method called by the engine everytime an **Anime** is analyzed across the website.

### GetVideoProxyHeaders

This method is used to get needed HTTP headers, in order to navigate throught original streaming video's url.

If you need to understand better how thing works, you can watch the websites already implemented, like [this one](https://github.com/AniAPI-Team/AniAPI/blob/main/SyncService/Models/Websites/GogoanimeWebsite.cs).

## WebsiteScraperService

Open `WebsiteScraperService.cs` under `Services` folder.

Add your website inside the `switch` at line 72, like the example below:
```csharp
//...

switch (website.Name)
{
    //...

    case "your_website_name": // Use the MongoDB's website collection name here!
        iWeb = new YourWebsiteName(website);
        break;

    //...
}

//...
```
