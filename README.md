This is the core behind AniAPI HTTP Rest APIs.
It uses **[Anilist](https://anilist.co)** as the principal Anime's reference and scrapes implemented websites to obtain episodes.
All songs are imported scraping **[AniPlaylist](https://aniplaylist.com/)**.

*Our scope is to provide a free-to-use API and let other developers care about relevant things for their applications* 😄

**[You can find the documentation on the APIs here](https://aniapi.com/docs)**
